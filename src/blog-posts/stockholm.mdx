### Field notes
Stockholm is built on 14 different islands, probably prefer it to Copenhagen because
it feels like there is much more to do, with plenty of scenic walks with the island hopping.

A summer only floating café and bar with seasonal menus and lush greenery.
Relax on a floating deck that gently sways with the rhythm of passing boats and the movement of the waves.

I never managed to go inside the store though word is it's a great secondhand vintage 
store filled with plenty of hidden treasures. However, what caught my eye were the
buildings on either sides of the wee street.

I only found out what the place was later, but as a big type fan,
I loved the unusual name and door.

Stockholm's subway were my favourite part of the trip, and possibly favourite
my train stations in the world so far. It is the world's largest art gallery with 90% of the
stations being individually decorated with cave-like art. You will need a ticket to
go in to snap some pics.
