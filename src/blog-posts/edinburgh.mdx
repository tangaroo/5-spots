The main purpose is to wander, without any real objectives though, it is the opposite
to doing nothing. According to Honoré de Balzac, Flânerie is “the gastronomy of the eye”.
Walter Benjamin, German Jewish philosopher described the flaneur as a modern urban spectator
and investigator of the city. Whilst they are gentlemen strollers of the city, they also play
a role in participating and shaping their surroundings.

Just a few minutes walk from the British Museum, it is a shop that sells new and vintage stationery and ephemera inspired by school days and traditional graphic design.

Perhaps a slight bias with their showing of My Neighbour Totoro, it's one of my favourite photo stops at night before Chinatown.

A 1920s inspired speakeasy bar with live jazz nights from 9pm every night, they also do incredible mocktails like the Midori. We visited on a sunday night and the service was very personal and attentive.

Filled with plenty of curated stores on both sides of the road, it's a designer's dream come true with indepednent cafes and shops like Sunspel, A.P.C, Aesop, Le Labo, Earl of East and more. If you want to visit one street for shopping (and great coffee), this is it.

# BONUS SHOUTOUTS

## [Spirited Away at the London Colosieum](https://www.barnightjar.com/shoreditch-reservations)
It's only showing for a limited amount of time, but one of the most incredible shows I've ever seen. The venue is also stunning.

## [Poetry Pharmacy](https://www.poetrypharmacy.co.uk/)
I loved the concept of this store. If you aren't interested in happy prescriptions, they also do poetical curses and maledictions.
