This was the first bakery that we visited around the corner of the hotel and we were 
greeted by a massive queue of people. Solid baguettes and so much pains.

A 3 story boutique store in a 19th century building, filled with vintage clothing, beautiful homeware, lifestyle and design items. 
Big fan of their socks.

Famous for its artistic heritage, it is a beautiful hilly area with steep winding 
cobble streets and brightly coloured shops and buildings. We loved how quiet it was
compared to the usual noisy bustle of the city.

Apart from it being home to one of the most famous paintings in the world, the architectural lines
of the musuem offered plenty of unusual perspectives of the building, particularly with
the sun coming through the glass roof.

A noteable street named after a local comedian with plenty of English inspired art 
deco houses. This street is tucked away from the main areas of Montmartre.
