This was the first bakery that we visited around the corner of the hotel and we were greeted by a massive queue of people. Solid baguettes.

Just a few minutes walk from the British Museum, it is a shop that sells new and vintage stationery and ephemera inspired by school days and traditional graphic design.

A 1920s inspired speakeasy bar with live jazz nights from 9pm every night, they also do incredible mocktails like the Midori. We visited on a sunday night and the service was very personal and attentive.

Filled with plenty of curated stores on both sides of the road, it's a designer's dream come true with indepednent cafes and shops like Sunspel, A.P.C, Aesop, Le Labo, Earl of East and more. If you want to visit one street for shopping (and great coffee), this is it.

# BONUS SHOUTOUTS

## [Spirited Away at the London Colosieum](https://www.barnightjar.com/shoreditch-reservations)
It's only showing for a limited amount of time, but one of the most incredible shows I've ever seen. The venue is also stunning.

## [Poetry Pharmacy](https://www.poetrypharmacy.co.uk/)
I loved the concept of this store. If you aren't interested in happy prescriptions, they also do poetical curses and maledictions.
