### FIELD NOTES
Loved the Hoxton Shoreditch. Peak times on the tube are between 06:30 and 09:30, and 16:00 and 19:00 on weekdays. 
The tube is easily another 10°C warmer in the summer - don't do it.

Just a few minutes walk from the British Museum, it is a shop that sells new and vintage stationery and ephemera inspired by school days and traditional graphic design.

Perhaps a slight bias with their showing of My Neighbour Totoro, it's one of my favourite photo stops at night before Chinatown.

A 1920s inspired speakeasy bar with live jazz nights from 9pm every night, they also do incredible mocktails like the Midori. We visited on a sunday night and the service was very personal and attentive.

Filled with plenty of curated stores on both sides of the road, it's a designer's dream come true with indepednent cafes and shops like Sunspel, A.P.C, Aesop, Le Labo, Earl of East and more. If you want to visit one street for shopping (and great coffee), this is it.

A much loved summer concept store from Anya Hindmarch - it is back for the third time. The wee store is packed with 20 unusual flavours of ice-cream from Heinz Beans to Jaffa Cakes, many others, along with my favourite Kikkoman Soy Sauce.

# BONUS SHOUTOUTS
  ## [Spirited Away at the London Colosieum](https://www.barnightjar.com/shoreditch-reservations) 
  It's only showing for a limited amount of time, but one of the most incredible shows
  I've ever seen. The venue is also stunning.

  ## [Poetry Pharmacy](https://www.poetrypharmacy.co.uk/) 
  I loved the concept of this store. If you aren't interested in happy prescriptions, 
  they also do poetical curses and maledictions.

  ## [Gloria](https://www.bigmammagroup.com/en/trattorias/gloria) 
  Beautifully decorated interiors and exteriors with eclectic decor, Gloria serves 
  hearty Italian food that is worth all its calories.
