The main purpose is to wander, without any real objectives though, it is the opposite
to doing nothing. According to Honoré de Balzac, Flânerie is “the gastronomy of the eye”.
Walter Benjamin, German Jewish philosopher described the flaneur as a modern urban spectator
and investigator of the city. Whilst they are gentlemen strollers of the city, they also play
a role in participating and shaping their surroundings.

In the 1990s where the internet boom happened, the cyberflâneur emerged. During the early
days of the internet, surfing the web was a form of art without the presence of
Google or Facebook to organize information the way it is today. The gradual decline of the
historical flâneurs were brought about by the modernization of the streets with larger, exposed
common parks. Similarly, the cyberflâneurs followed suit after the introduction and fast growth
of Google and Facebook’s presence.

A lot of what we do as designers is rooted in context. Everything we see around us are both
problems and inspiration — we may see great solutions that others have came up with or noticed
potential improvements that could be made. Sites like Behance and Dribble allow for the same artistic
exploration that were done by flâneurs in the cities.

However, what we tend to forget about are the things that we do not see. Consider the [knowns
and unknowns framework](https://uxdesign.cc/the-knowns-and-unknowns-framework-for-design-thinking-6537787de2c5) — what we do not see could be the known unknowns or unknown unknowns.
When it comes to knowledge, known knowns are facts, known unknowns are questions.
Unknown knowns are intuition and unknown unknowns are exploration, a trait strongly tied to
the historical flaneurs.

Exploration in the unknown unknown context would indicate observation without purpose,
but purely for investigation. By exploring our surroundings and experiences without
any direction, we often take an unbiased and uninformed approach to finding potential
opportunities. Similarly with the known unknown questions, we can dive deeper into
investigating and answering these queries. The only difference is that there is are
slightly more tangible grounds to start with.

Theories are often built on existing knowledge and the curse of knowledge is a cognitive
bias where one assumes others have the same context and background to understand
certain information. Exploration can help break these barriers to find new
information because it is taking a leap into the unknown. For example, hypotheses
are derived from known unknowns by reframing questions whereas research and exploration
can help better understand the unknowns. Observation is also part of investigation.

Like the flâneur, to solve an unknown unknown requires an open mind. Only with an
open mind can we see problems with fresh eyes to produce new, innovative and
meaningful solutions that are not just carbon copies of trends that exist on the market.

Forget about Google, Behance and Dribble for a second and return to analog
methods of research — go out there in the world and carefully observe. Make
your own notes on what you see or not see and develop your own conclusions
without any prior contexts.
