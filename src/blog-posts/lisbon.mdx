### FIELD NOTES
Remember to factor in time for going up and down the hills. Plenty of hills and cobble 
paths so comfortable footwear would be wise. Birkenstocks worked out well for the 5 days.

Tucked away under the Teatro da Caragem is a Café by day, bar by night but both with 
amazing views of the city. They also do excellent simple breakfasts.

One of the most memorable local restaurants that I have dined in so far, and probably
the only one so far that I've ever felt was worth an hour's wait. Between the delicious 
homecooked food and personal service, it felt just like you were dining at your 
Portugese grandma's house. 

Start queuing before 7pm if you don't want to be standing outside for an hour waiting
on a table.

A cultural center that doubles up as a library and co-working space, it is a hidden
peaceful gem amongst the bustle in the area. There is a bookstore that is every 
designer's dream, café as well as rooms with beautiful ceilings and 
interiors to study in.

Amongst the tall trees and historical castles, the city truly felt like something out 
of a fairytale. Just a 3 euro and 45 minutes ride away, the Pena Palace, Moorish Castle and Quinta da Regaleira were all
equally as stunning and worth the trip (even with the hills).

Originally opened in 1930, this cannery sells plenty of quality conserved fish that
make great souvenirs. Canned mackarel, sardines, squid and cod are available in a variety
of flavours ranging from 3 to 8 euros each.

  A 20th century neo-Arab palace transformed into a curated commercial gallery selling
  local designer brands and artwork.

  ## [MAAT](https://www.maat.pt/pt/) 
  I never got the chance to enter the museum but both the exterior and interior seemed
  like a great place for fantastic photos.

  ## [Pomme Eatery](https://www.instagram.com/pomme_eatery/) 
  More of a fancy treat now and then, from the delicious food to beautifully crafted
  interiors, the entire dining experience was incredible.
