### Field notes
Barely any cars but look out for the army of cyclists. They grit the bicycle lanes before
the roads. About an average of 40,000 cyclists across the bridge each day.

Think MUJI aesthetics, but designer. It is my favourite store to shop at for the capsule
wardrobe. Muted tones, minimal and luxurious fabrics. With only two stores in the world - New York City and Copenhagen.

Three things at once - great for perfumery and homeware, food at [Apotek 57](https://framacph.com/blogs/stores/apotek-57) which 
is inside the studio, and beautiful interiors for photos. Photo is from [Frama](https://framacph.com/).

Great place to spend the day in the summer with a global street food market, bars, live
entertainment and a view of the harbour. So much good noms.

Something I just stumbled upon my walk back to the hotel at night - big large neon sign.
Huset is a large cultural house for concerts, spoken words, cinema and theatre.

One of my favourite furniture stores from the trip, Paustian transformed a 19th century bank 
into a showroom. However, you'll still find surprises of the original building throughout
the store along with hidden light installations.

Hidden in plain sight underwater nearby Christiansborg Palace, they are a group of bronze
sculptures located next to the Højbro Bridge.

## [Scandinavian Design Tour](https://andlight.co.uk/shop/copenhagen-design-tour-15593p.html)
Muuto, Hay, Ferm Living, Gubi, &Tradition, Menu, the list keeps going. It's worth
a day trip of window shopping.
